# 1.7 AI Developer vs ML Engineer 
 
 You're absolutely right to want a deeper breakdownâ€”AI Developer and ML Engineer roles often overlap, but their focus, skillsets, and responsibilities diverge in meaningful ways. Here's a structured comparison to help you clearly distinguish between them:

# ðŸ§  AI Developer vs. ML Engineer: Role & Skillset Comparison

| **Aspect**              | **AI Developer**                                                    | **ML Engineer**                                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus**        | Building intelligent systems using a variety of AI techniques       | Designing, training, and deploying scalable ML models             |
| **Scope of Work**        | Broader AI applications (NLP, CV, expert systems, etc.)            | Narrower focus on ML algorithms and data-driven modeling          |
| **Tool Expertise**       | IBM Watson, AWS SageMaker, GCP AI, Azure AI Studio                 | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, MLflow, Airflow                |
| **Model Integration**    | Less concerned with system integration                              | Deeply involved in integrating models into production systems     |
| **Infrastructure Knowledge** | Limited cloud and DevOps exposure                              | Strong grasp of cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), containers, CI/CD |
| **Data Handling**        | Focused on insights and visualization                               | Focused on pipelines, feature engineering, and data versioning    |
| **End Goal**             | Validate business theories and build intelligent prototypes        | Deliver robust, scalable ML solutions that meet customer needs    |
| **Deployment Skills**    | Basic deployment, often in sandbox environments                    | Production-grade deployment with monitoring, rollback, and scaling |
| **Collaboration**        | Works with business analysts and domain experts                    | Works with data engineers, software engineers, and DevOps teams   |
| **Algorithm Depth**      | Basic understanding of ML algorithms                               | Deep expertise in supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning |


# ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Examples
* **AI Developer** might build a chatbot using NLP and integrate it with a CRM system using pre-built APIs.

* **ML Engineer** would optimize the chatbotâ€™s intent classification model, ensure it scales under load, and monitor performance in production.
