# 1.8 AI Developer vs AI Engineer 
 
Let‚Äôs break this down into a clear, structured comparison between **AI Developers** and **AI Engineer**s, with emphasis on their skillsets, responsibilities, and tools. I‚Äôll also weave in some excellent video resources that expand on these roles in practice.

# üß† AI Developer vs. üõ†Ô∏è AI Engineer: Role & Skillset Comparison

| Category                    | AI Developer                                                | AI Engineer                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus**            | Building AI/ML models to solve business problems            | Scaling, integrating, and deploying AI solutions              |
| **Objective**                | Validate business theories using data-driven models         | Ensure models are production-ready and system-compatible      |
| **System Integration**       | Not a priority; models often remain standalone              | Core responsibility; integrates models into enterprise systems|
| **Visualization & Insights** | Strong focus on data storytelling and insight generation    | Builds tools to deliver insights to stakeholders via dashboards|
| **AI Knowledge Depth**       | Deep understanding of AI/ML algorithms and techniques       | Basic AI/ML knowledge, stronger in software engineering       |
| **Infrastructure Skills**    | Limited; not focused on deployment environments            | Strong; includes cloud, containerization, CI/CD pipelines     |
| **Tool Expertise**           | AI platforms like IBM Watson, GCP AI, AWS SageMaker         | Production tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Azure MLOps, Airflow|
| **End User Orientation**     | Business analysts, data scientists                          | Product managers, software teams, end customers               |
| **UI & Dashboard Development** | Rarely involved                                          | Frequently builds custom dashboards and data apps             |
