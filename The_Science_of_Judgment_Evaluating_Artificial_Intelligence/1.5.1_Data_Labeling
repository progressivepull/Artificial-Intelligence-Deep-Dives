# Data Labeling

In machine learning, labeled data is a group of raw data samples, such as images, text, or audio, that have been annotated with informative tags or a specific category. These labels provide context and act as the "correct answer" that a supervised learning model uses during its training phase.
For example, to train a model to recognize different animals, a dataset would contain:

* An image of a cat tagged with the label "cat".

* An image of a dog tagged with the label "dog".


## How data labeling works
The process of creating labeled data, also known as data annotation, involves several steps:

* **Collection**: Raw, unlabeled data is gathered from various sources, such as public datasets or internal databases.

* **Labeling**: Human experts, also called annotators, assign the correct labels based on specific guidelines. Automated and semi-automated methods are also used, where algorithms suggest labels that humans then review.

* **Quality assurance**: The labeled data is checked for accuracy and consistency to ensure high-quality training material.

* **Ground truth**: The final, verified labeled dataset becomes the "ground truth"â€”a benchmark for a model to evaluate its own predictions.

## Labeled vs. unlabeled data
The key distinction between labeled and unlabeled data is its role in different types of machine learning.

|             | Labeled Data                                         |	Unlabeled Data                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Used in...  | Supervised learning, where the model learns from examples with known correct outputs.     | Unsupervised learning, where the model analyzes raw data to find hidden patterns and structures.    |
| Creation    | Requires significant human effort, making it more time-consuming and expensive to create. | Is easier to acquire, as it is just raw data without any prior annotation.  |
| Output      | Used to train models for specific tasks like classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., forecasting). | Used for exploratory analysis, such as clustering customer data to find market segments. |


## Applications of labeled data
Labeled data is foundational to many machine learning applications, including:

* **Computer vision**: Image labels are used to train models for object detection, facial recognition, and image segmentation.

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text is labeled to train models for tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbots.

* **Audio processing**: Audio clips are transcribed and tagged to enable speech recognition and emotion detection in voice.

* **Medical imaging**: Radiologists label medical scans to help AI models accurately detect diseases.
