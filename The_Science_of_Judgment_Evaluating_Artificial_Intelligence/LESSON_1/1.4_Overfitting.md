# 1.4 Overfitting 
 
 ## üìå What Is Overfitting?

### üîç Definition
**Overfitting** occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well‚Äîincluding its noise and random fluctuations‚Äîrather than the true underlying patterns. This leads to poor generalization on new, unseen data.

Think of it like a student who memorizes every word in a textbook for an exam but fails to apply the concepts in real-world scenarios.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Overfitting Is a Problem
- The model performs well on training data but poorly on validation or test data.
- It captures irrelevant patterns that don‚Äôt generalize.
- It can lead to misleadingly high accuracy during training.
