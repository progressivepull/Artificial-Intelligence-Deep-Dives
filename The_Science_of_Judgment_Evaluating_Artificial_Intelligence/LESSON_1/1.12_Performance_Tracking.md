# 1.12 Performance Tracking 
 
# üìà What Is Performance Tracking?
Performance tracking is the **ongoing process of monitoring, evaluating, and adapting ML models** after deployment. It ensures that models continue to deliver accurate, fair, and useful predictions in dynamic environments.

Unlike one-time evaluation, tracking is **continuous**, enabling:

* Early detection of issues
* Timely model updates
* Strategic decision-making

# üéØ Why Performance Tracking Matters

# üìà Benefits of Continuous Model Monitoring

| Benefit              | Description                                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal Alignment**    | Ensures models stay aligned with business objectives                  |
| **Quality Assurance** | Prevents errors, maintains standards, supports compliance             |
| **Adaptability**      | Detects model drift and adapts to changing data distributions         |
| **Transparency**      | Builds trust and supports ethical AI practices                        |
| **Data-Driven Decisions** | Informs resource allocation, model selection, and retraining     |


# Key Evaluation Metrics

## üìä Metrics to Monitor by Task Type

| Task Type              | Metrics to Monitor                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classification**     | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC             |
| **Regression**         | MAE, MSE, RMSE, R¬≤                                        |
| **Ranking / Recommendation** | NDCG, MAP, Hit Rate                                |
| **Fairness**           | Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Disparate Impact    |

# Operational Metrics

* **Latency**: Time to generate predictions
* **Throughpu**t: Number of predictions per second
* **Error rates**: System or prediction failures
* **Drift detection**: Changes in data distribution or feature importance

# üß† Decision-Making Workflow

**1. Collect** performance data continuously             
**2. Analyze** metrics for drift, degradation, or bias                 
**3. Identify** areas for improvement                     
**4. Collaborate** across data science, engineering, and business teams            
**5. Adapt** models using retraining, tuning, or replacement                     
**6. Validate** changes with updated metrics and stakeholder feedback
