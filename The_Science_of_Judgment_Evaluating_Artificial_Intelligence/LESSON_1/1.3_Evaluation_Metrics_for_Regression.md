# 1.3 Evaluation Metrics for Regression 
 
 Let’s take a deeper dive into the four core regression evaluation metrics—MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared—and explore their mathematical intuition, practical applications, and strategic importance in real-world scenarios.

 ## 📊 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### 🔍 Definition
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

### 📐 Formula


\[
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|
\]



### ✅ Why It Matters
- **Interpretability**: MAE is expressed in the same unit as the target variable, making it intuitive and easy to understand.
- **Use Case**: Ideal when you want a balanced view of prediction errors without disproportionately penalizing large deviations.

### ⚠️ Limitation
- **Outlier Sensitivity**: While less sensitive than Mean Squared Error (MSE), MAE still treats all errors equally—whether small or large—without differentiation.
