# 1.3 Evaluation Metrics for Regression 
 
 Let‚Äôs take a deeper dive into the four core regression evaluation metrics‚ÄîMAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared‚Äîand explore their mathematical intuition, practical applications, and strategic importance in real-world scenarios.

 ## üìä 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### üîç Definition
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

### üìê Formula


$$
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|
$$



### ‚úÖ Why It Matters
- **Interpretability**: MAE is expressed in the same unit as the target variable, making it intuitive and easy to understand.
- **Use Case**: Ideal when you want a balanced view of prediction errors without disproportionately penalizing large deviations.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation
- **Outlier Sensitivity**: While less sensitive than Mean Squared Error (MSE), MAE still treats all errors equally‚Äîwhether small or large‚Äîwithout differentiation.

## üìê 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### üîç Definition
Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. Squaring the errors amplifies larger deviations, making MSE particularly sensitive to outliers.

### üìê Formula


$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2
$$



### ‚úÖ Why It Matters
- **Penalty for Large Errors**: MSE disproportionately penalizes larger mistakes, making it valuable when large errors are especially costly.
- **Model Tuning**: Commonly used as a loss function during training to optimize model accuracy.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- **Unit Mismatch**: Because errors are squared, the resulting metric is in squared units, which can make interpretation less intuitive.
- **Outlier Amplification**: Highly sensitive to extreme values, which can skew the overall error metric.
