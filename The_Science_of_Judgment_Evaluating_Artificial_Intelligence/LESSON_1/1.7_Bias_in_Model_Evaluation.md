# 1.7 Bias in Model Evaluation 
 
 # ⚖️ Understanding Bias in Model Evaluation
Bias in ML evaluation occurs when the assessment process fails to reflect real-world diversity or fairness. This leads to misleading performance metrics and potentially harmful decisions.

# ⚖️ Types of Bias in Machine Learning

| Type              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sampling Bias** | Evaluation data doesn't represent the target population                     |
| **Algorithmic Bias** | Model learns patterns that reflect societal or data-driven inequalities |
| **Historical Bias**  | Biases embedded in past data persist in model predictions                |
| **Evaluation Bias**  | Testing data or metrics fail to capture fairness across groups           |

# 📉 Why Traditional Metrics Fall Short

Metrics like **accuracy, precision, and recall** are useful — but they don’t tell the whole story.

---

## 🔍 Example
A credit scoring model might show:  
- ✅ High **precision** overall  
- ⚠️ Low **recall** for low-income applicants  
- ❌ High **false positives** for minority groups  

This can lead to:  
- Misleading conclusions  
- Skewed approval rates  
- Systemic financial exclusion  

---

## 🛠️ Mitigating Evaluation Bias
To build a more **equitable evaluation framework**:  

### 1. **Ensure Representative Evaluation Data**  
   - Include diverse demographic groups  
   - Avoid over-representing majority populations  
   - Use stratified sampling when possible  

### 2. Use Fairness Metrics
Go beyond traditional metrics. Consider:

# 📏 Fairness Metrics in Machine Learning

| Metric               | What It Measures                                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Demographic Parity** | Equal positive prediction rates across groups        |
| **Equal Opportunity**  | Equal true positive rates across groups              |
| **Disparate Impact**   | Ratio of outcomes between groups                     |
| **Calibration by Group** | Predictive accuracy across demographics           |

# ✅ Steps Toward Fair Evaluation

### 3. Disaggregate Performance
- Break down metrics by **race, gender, income level**, etc.  
- Identify disparities hidden in **aggregate scores**  

### 4. Integrate Ethical Guidelines
- Define **fairness goals** early  
- Include stakeholders from **affected communities**  
- Document **assumptions and limitations**  

### 5. Promote Transparency & Explainability
- Use **interpretable models** or post-hoc explainers (e.g., *SHAP, LIME*)  
- Share how **decisions are made and evaluated**

# 🧾 Real-World Scenario: Credit Scoring
In the bank’s case:  
- ❌ Unrepresentative test data excluded **low-income groups**  
- ⚠️ Precision-only evaluation masked **unfair outcomes**  
- 🚫 Ignored sensitive attributes like **socio-economic status**  

### 🔥 Consequences
- High precision ≠ **fair decisions**  
- Approval rates **skewed** against marginalized groups  
- **Systemic disparities** reinforced  

---

# 🧭 Final Takeaway
Bias in evaluation isn’t just a **technical flaw** — it’s an **ethical failure**.  
By embracing **fairness metrics**, **diverse data**, and **transparent practices**, we move toward **responsible AI** that serves *everyone*, not just the majority.
