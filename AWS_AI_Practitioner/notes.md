## Why Do These Principles Matter?

### Critical Questions to Ask
- Was the AI system fair in how it evaluated you?
- Is the process transparent, or just a mysterious “black box”?
- Can someone explain what went wrong?

### These Questions Point to Three Core Principles of Ethical AI
- **Fairness**: Were you treated equitably?
- **Transparency**: Can you see or understand how decisions were made?
- **Explainability**: Can the outcome be broken down in a way that makes sense?

### These principles aren’t just theoretical – they affect real people, every day.
