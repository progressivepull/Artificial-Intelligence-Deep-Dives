# üìã Requirements for AI Report with Stakeholder Considerations

## 1. Define the Purpose of the AI System
- Clearly state objectives, scope, and intended use cases.  
- Identify performance metrics (accuracy, fairness, efficiency).

## 2. Transparency & Explainability
- Provide model overview (black box vs. interpretable).  
- Share assumptions, inputs, and outputs.

### üîç Transparency vs. Explainability in AI

#### üü¶ Transparency
- **Definition**: Openness about how an AI system is designed, trained, and deployed.  
- **Focus**: The *process* ‚Äî data sources, model architecture, training methods, and decision pipelines.  
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Disclosure of data provenance and preprocessing.
  - Sharing performance metrics and limitations.
  - Documenting system updates and governance.  
- **Audience**: Regulators, compliance officers, and organizations seeking accountability.  
- **Goal**: Build trust by showing *nothing is hidden* in the AI lifecycle.

#### üü© Explainability
- **Definition**: Ability to make individual AI predictions or behaviors understandable.  
- **Focus**: The *output* ‚Äî why a specific decision or prediction was made.  
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Feature importance (e.g., SHAP values, LIME).
  - Visualizations (e.g., saliency maps, decision trees).
  - Counterfactual explanations (‚ÄúIf X had been different, Y would have changed‚Äù).  
- **Audience**: End-users, business stakeholders, and technical teams who need actionable insights.  
- **Goal**: Make AI *comprehensible and usable* in real-world decision-making.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Difference
- **Transparency = seeing inside the box** (the design, data, and processes).  
- **Explainability = understanding the outputs** (why a specific decision happened).

## 3. Use Explainable AI (XAI) Techniques
- Apply SHAP values, saliency maps, or model cards.  
- Visualize decision-making for non-technical stakeholders.

## 4. Business Impact & Trust
- Explain AI‚Äôs effect on decision-making, risk, and customer experience.  
- Emphasize accountability and reliability.

## 6. Compare Interpretability Methods
- Contrast intrinsic interpretability (decision trees, linear models) vs. post-hoc explanations.  
- Provide justification for chosen method.

## 7. Case Studies & Real-World Examples
- Demonstrate model outputs with real or simulated data.  
- Use case studies to show stakeholder relevance.
