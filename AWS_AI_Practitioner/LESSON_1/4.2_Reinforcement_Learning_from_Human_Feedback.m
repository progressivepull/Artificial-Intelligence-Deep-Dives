# 4.2 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a machine learning technique used to train AI models—especially large language models (LLMs)—to better align with complex human preferences and values. Instead of relying solely on predefined reward functions, RLHF uses human judgments to guide the model toward generating helpful, truthful, and harmless responses.

This approach addresses a key challenge in AI: the difficulty of designing automated reward functions that capture the nuance and subjectivity of human expectations.

## The Multi-Step RLHF Process

RLHF typically involves three core stages:

### 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

- **Goal**: Establish a strong base model.
- **Process**: Human annotators create high-quality demonstrations ("golden answers") for diverse prompts. These prompt-response pairs are used to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM in a supervised manner.

### 2. Reward Model (RM) Training

- **Goal**: Train a model to approximate human preferences.
- **Process**:
  - The SFT model generates multiple responses for a prompt.
  - Annotators rank these responses from best to worst.
  - This ranking data is used to train a reward model that predicts a score for any response based on human preferences.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Optimization

- **Goal**: Fine-tune the base model to maximize reward scores.
- **Process**:
  - The SFT model generates new responses.
  - The reward model scores each response.
  - An RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) adjusts the model to increase reward scores.
  - A penalty term is often added to prevent the model from drifting too far from its original capabilities.

## Why RLHF Is Important for LLMs

- **Improved Alignment**  
  Ensures responses are helpful, harmless, and aligned with human values.

- **Enhanced User Experience**  
  Produces more engaging, contextually appropriate, and natural-sounding outputs.

- **Reduced Toxicity and Bias**  
  Guides models away from generating harmful or biased content.

- **Minimized Hallucinations**  
  Helps models avoid fabricating inaccurate information and encourages honest uncertainty.

- **Scalability**  
  Reward models enable scalable feedback automation, reducing reliance on manual labeling.

## Challenges and Alternatives

### Challenges

- High cost and time required for collecting quality human feedback.
- Risk of reinforcing biases if annotator diversity is lacking.

### Alternatives

- **Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF)**  
  Uses another AI model or rule-based system ("constitution") to provide alignment feedback.

- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**  
  Eliminates the need for a separate reward model by directly optimizing the LLM using human preference data in a supervised learning framework.
