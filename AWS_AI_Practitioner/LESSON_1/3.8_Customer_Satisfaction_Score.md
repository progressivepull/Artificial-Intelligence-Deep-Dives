# 3.8 Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

**CSAT AI**, or AI-powered CSAT, is an advanced approach that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze customer interactions and predict or infer customer satisfaction scores—without relying solely on traditional post-interaction surveys. It addresses common limitations such as low response rates and response bias by analyzing a broader spectrum of customer feedback and behavioral data.

## How CSAT AI Works

Instead of asking customers for a rating, CSAT AI uses multiple techniques to infer satisfaction levels from interactions:

- **Data Collection**  
  Gathers data from emails, chat logs, transcribed phone calls, social media posts, and online reviews.

- **Language and Sentiment Analysis**  
  NLP models detect sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), emotions (e.g., anger, happiness, frustration), and their intensity.

- **Contextual and Behavioral Analysis**  
  Advanced systems analyze resolution time, agent handoffs, and agent behavior to assess satisfaction (source: eesel AI).

- **Score Prediction**  
  Combines insights to predict a CSAT score (typically 1–5 or 1–100) for each interaction (source: Sprinklr).

- **Insights and Reporting**  
  Aggregates scores into dashboards and reports to monitor trends, identify satisfaction drivers, and evaluate performance across channels and agents.
