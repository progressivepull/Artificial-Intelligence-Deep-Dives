## Core Concepts

- **Intents**  
  Represent actions the user wants to perform (e.g., ordering a pizza, booking a hotel).

- **Utterances**  
  Phrases users say or type to invoke an intent (e.g., "I want to order a pizza" triggers the `OrderPizza` intent).

- **Slots**  
  Specific pieces of information needed to fulfill an intent (e.g., pizza size, crust type, toppings).

- **Fulfillment**  
  Business logic executed once all required slots are collectedâ€”often handled via AWS Lambda integration.
