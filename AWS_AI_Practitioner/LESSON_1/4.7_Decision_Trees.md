# 4.7 Decision Trees

A **decision tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses a flowchart-like structure to make decisions or predictions. It works by splitting a dataset into smaller, more homogeneous subsets based on a series of questions about the data's features.

## How Decision Trees Work

A decision tree consists of several components:

- **Root Node**: Represents the entire dataset and is the starting point of the tree.
- **Internal Nodes**: Decision points where data is split based on specific features.
- **Branches**: Paths between nodes representing possible outcomes or decisions.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Endpoints that represent the final decision or prediction.

### Building a Decision Tree

1. **Select the Best Attribute**  
   Choose the feature that best divides the data into pure subsets using metrics like *Gini impurity* or *information gain*.

2. **Split the Data**  
   Divide the dataset into branches based on the selected feature (e.g., "weather" â†’ "sunny", "cloudy", "rainy").

3. **Recursively Repeat**  
   Continue splitting at each node until classification is complete or no further improvement is possible.

4. **Prune the Tree**  
   Remove low-importance branches to reduce complexity and prevent overfitting.

## Types of Decision Trees

- **Classification Trees**  
  Predict categorical outcomes (e.g., "spam" vs. "not spam").

- **Regression Trees**  
  Predict continuous numerical values (e.g., house prices).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Easy to interpret and visualize | Prone to overfitting if not pruned |
| Minimal data preparation | Instability with small data changes |
| Handles non-linear relationships | Potential for bias in imbalanced datasets |

## Real-World Applications

- **Finance**  
  Assess loan risk based on credit scores and financial history.

- **Medicine**  
  Diagnose diseases using symptoms and lab results.

- **Marketing**  
  Segment customers for targeted campaigns.

- **Operations**  
  Aid autonomous vehicles in decision-making based on traffic and road conditions.
