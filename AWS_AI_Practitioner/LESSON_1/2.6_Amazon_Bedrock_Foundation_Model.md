# 2.6 Amazon Bedrock Foundation Model (FM)

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides easy access to a selection of high-performing, ready-to-use foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies, as well as models built by Amazon. It offers a serverless experience, meaning developers do not need to manage any infrastructure to build and scale generative AI applications.

## The Concept of a Foundation Model (FM)

A foundation model is a large-scale, pre-trained AI model trained on massive amounts of unannotated data from diverse sources such as text, code, and images. This broad training gives FMs general-purpose capabilities, enabling them to:

- Generate text, images, and code
- Answer questions
- Perform a wide range of tasks across domains

## How Amazon Bedrock Uses FMs

Amazon Bedrock allows developers to choose from a curated list of FM providers, including:

- AI21 Labs  
- Amazon (Titan models)  
- Anthropic (Claude series)  
- Cohere  
- DeepSeek  
- Luma AI  
- Meta (Llama family)  
- Mistral AI  
- OpenAI  
- Stability AI  
- TwelveLabs  
- Writer  

This variety helps developers balance performance, cost, and accuracy for their specific use cases.

## Customization and Data Privacy

Amazon Bedrock supports multiple customization options while maintaining data privacy:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Use Bedrock Knowledge Bases to securely connect FMs to your data sources. Relevant information is retrieved and used to augment prompts, improving response accuracy without retraining.

- **Fine-Tuning and Continued Pre-Training**  
  Train a private copy of an FM on labeled datasets for task-specific optimization. Titan models also support continued pre-training with large unlabeled datasets for domain adaptation.

- **Custom Model Import**  
  Organizations can bring proprietary or custom-tuned models into Bedrock and use them alongside pre-built FMs.

## Key Features for Generative AI Development

Amazon Bedrock offers a robust suite of tools to build and scale generative AI applications:

- **Agents**  
  Extend FM reasoning to perform multi-step business tasks by calling APIs and gathering data.

- **Guardrails**  
  Apply safety filters to block harmful content, remove PII, and reduce hallucinations based on your policies.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Compare models using automated or human evaluation workflows to select the best fit.

- **Serverless Infrastructure**  
  Pay only for what you useâ€”no need to manage hardware or provisioning.
