## How QuickSight Q Works

QuickSight Q uses a multi-step process to answer natural language questions:

1. **Create a Q Topic**  
   A QuickSight author creates a "topic" using a dataset. Q's AI-enhanced data prep tags key information, categorizes fields, and suggests friendly names and synonyms.

2. **Ask a Question**  
   Users ask questions in natural language, such as "What were our sales in California last month?"

3. **Generate a Response**  
   Q's generative AI engine processes the question and returns a multi-visual answer, including graphs and written summaries. It can also produce executive summaries and data stories.

## Best Practices

- **Adhere to Least Privilege**  
  Assign roles (Admin, Author, Reader) based on user responsibilities to ensure secure data access.

- **Curate Q Topics**  
  Refine field names, add synonyms, and restrict inappropriate aggregations to improve accuracy and usability.

- **Optimize Data Sets**  
  Use custom SQL or filters to limit fields and columns for better performance, especially with live queries. Avoid long or high-cardinality fields.
