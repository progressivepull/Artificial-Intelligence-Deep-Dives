# 1.5 Model Convergence Tables

# 📊 What Are Model Convergence Tables?
Model convergence tables are used in numerical modeling (especially in fields like hydrology, economics, and machine learning) to track whether a model’s iterative solution is stabilizing. Here's what they typically show:

* **Iteration count**: How many steps the solver has taken.
* **Residual error**: The difference between successive iterations—ideally shrinking over time.
* **Convergence criteria**: Thresholds that determine when the model is “close enough” to a stable solution.
* **Parameter updates**: How model parameters change with each iteration.

# 🧠 Why Convergence Matters
In numerical simulations (e.g., groundwater flow models using MODFLOW), convergence ensures that the solution is valid and stable. If a model doesn’t converge, it might be due to:

* Poor initial conditions or parameter guesses
* Inappropriate boundary conditions
* Zero or negative cell thickness (in grid-based models)
* Isolated active cells surrounded by dry ones
