## Key Features

### 1. Bias Detection
- **Pre-training analysis**: Detects potential bias in the dataset before training.  
- **Post-training analysis**: Identifies bias in model predictions.  
- Supports multiple fairness metrics such as **disparate impact, statistical parity, and feature importance differences**.  

### 2. Explainability
- Provides **model explainability reports** to understand **feature contributions** to predictions.  
- Supports multiple explainability techniques, including:
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
  - Feature importance scores
- Helps stakeholders interpret **why a model makes certain decisions**.  

### 3. Integration with SageMaker Ecosystem
- Works with **SageMaker training jobs, endpoints, and batch transform jobs**.  
- Compatible with models built using **built-in algorithms, custom algorithms, and popular ML frameworks**.  

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring
- Supports **real-time bias and explainability monitoring** for models deployed in production.  
- Detects changes in data distribution and potential drift in fairness metrics.  

### 5. Reporting and Visualization
- Generates comprehensive **bias and explainability reports** in JSON or HTML.  
- Visualizes:
  - Feature importance distributions
  - Bias metrics per feature and target group
  - Model decision breakdowns

## Workflow

1. **Data Analysis**
   - Perform pre-training dataset analysis for bias detection.  

2. **Model Training**
   - Train ML models using SageMaker or bring your own model.  

3. **Bias and Explainability Assessment**
   - Post-training analysis to detect bias in model predictions.  
   - Generate feature importance and explainability reports.  

4. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Deploy the model to an endpoint or batch job.  
   - Monitor real-time predictions for fairness and feature contribution shifts.  

5. **Actionable Insights**
   - Adjust training datasets, features, or model parameters to mitigate detected bias.  
   - Improve transparency and trustworthiness of ML models.
