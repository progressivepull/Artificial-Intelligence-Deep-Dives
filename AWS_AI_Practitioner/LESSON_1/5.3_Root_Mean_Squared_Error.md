# 5.3 Root mean squared error (RMSE)

## üìä Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in AI & Machine Learning
The **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is a key metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models in AI and machine learning. It quantifies the difference between predicted values and actual observed values, essentially representing the **standard deviation of prediction errors**.

A **smaller RMSE** indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, suggesting higher predictive accuracy.

##üßÆ How RMSE Is Calculated
The RMSE is derived from the ##Mean Squared Error (MSE)##, with an added step of taking the square root:

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Actual_i - Predicted_i)^2}
$$

## Steps to Calculate RMSE

1. **Calculate the residuals**  
For each data point, subtract the predicted value from the actual value:  

$$
\text{Residual}_i = \text{Actual}_i - \text{Predicted}_i
$$

2. **Square each residual**  
This ensures all values are positive and emphasizes larger errors:  
   

$$
\text{Squared Residual}_i = (\text{Residual}_i)^2
$$

3. **Compute the mean of the squared residuals**  
This gives the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:  
   
$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{Residual}_i)^2
$$


4. **Take the square root of the MSE**  
This gives the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, returning the error to the same unit as the target variable:  
   
$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}
$$

## ü§ñ Why RMSE Is Used in AI

* **Intuitive interpretation**                  
RMSE is in the same units as the target variable, making it easy to understand. Example: If predicting house prices in dollars, an RMSE of $2,000 means the model is off by $2,000 on average.

* **Sensitivity to large errors**                   
Squaring errors gives more weight to large deviations, which is useful in high-risk domains like finance or safety-critical systems.

* **Optimization target**                  
RMSE is often used as the loss function during model training. Minimizing RMSE pushes the model toward more accurate predictions.

* **Model comparison**                   
RMSE provides a standardized way to compare regression models. Lower RMSE = better performance (assuming same dataset).

## Comparison of RMSE vs MAE

| **Feature**               | **RMSE**                                                                 | **MAE**                                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sensitivity to outliers   | More sensitive due to squaring errors                                   | Less sensitive; treats all errors equally                      |
| Penalizes large errors    | Heavily penalizes large errors                                          | Equal weight to all errors                                     |
| Interpretation            | Error is in the same unit as the target variable                        | Average absolute error; intuitive and easy to grasp            |
| Ideal for                 | Use cases where large errors are critical (e.g., finance, climate)      | Use cases where small and large errors should be treated equally |
