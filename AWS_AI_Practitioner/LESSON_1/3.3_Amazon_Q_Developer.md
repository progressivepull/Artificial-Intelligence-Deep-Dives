## Key Features

### Agentic Development

Amazon Q Developer uses advanced agents to autonomously perform complex, multi-step tasks:

- **Implement Features**  
  Describe a feature in natural language. Q analyzes the codebase, creates an implementation plan, and applies changes upon approval.

- **Generate Unit Tests**  
  Automatically creates unit tests to improve code coverage and reliability.

- **Automate Documentation**  
  Scans your codebase to generate and update documentation, including READMEs and data flow diagrams.

- **Review Code**  
  Performs automated reviews for quality, security, and best practices.

### Code Generation and Transformation

- **Inline Code Suggestions**  
  Offers real-time, multi-line suggestions in your IDE, with reported acceptance rates up to 50%.

- **Code Transformation**  
  Upgrades and modernizes applications (e.g., Java version upgrades, .NET Framework to cross-platform .NET).

### Security and Reliability

- **Security Scanning**  
  Detects vulnerabilities like exposed credentials and provides one-click remediations.

- **Automated Code Review**  
  Identifies and helps fix quality issues before merging.

### AWS-Native Intelligence

Amazon Q Developer is deeply integrated with AWS services:

- **AWS Management Console**  
  Chat with Q for expert guidance, troubleshooting, and cost analysis.

- **CLI Integration**  
  Use natural-language-to-bash translations and AI-generated autocompletions.

- **Console-to-Code**  
  Record actions in the console and generate reusable code in your preferred language.

### Contextual Awareness

- **Workspace Context**  
  The `/dev` command enables Q to consider your entire workspace for more relevant suggestions.

- **Customer-Specific Knowledge**  
  Enterprise customers can customize Q with private repositories and internal data for tailored recommendations.
