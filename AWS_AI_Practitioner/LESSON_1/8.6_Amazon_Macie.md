  - PII (names, social security numbers, addresses)  
  - Financial data (credit card numbers, bank account info)  
  - Credentials and secrets  

### 2. Data Classification
- Classifies data based on **sensitivity and content type**.  
- Creates **custom data identifiers** for organization-specific data.  
- Supports **predefined and custom classification rules**.  

### 3. Continuous Monitoring
- Automatically monitors data in S3 buckets for:
  - New sensitive data
  - Changes in data access patterns  
- Generates alerts for potential security risks.  

### 4. Security and Compliance Reporting
- Provides **dashboard and reporting tools** for compliance audits.  
- Supports regulatory frameworks including:
  - GDPR
  - HIPAA
  - PCI-DSS  

### 5. Integration with AWS Ecosystem
- Integrates with:
  - **AWS CloudTrail** for access auditing  
  - **Amazon CloudWatch** for alerting  
  - **AWS Security Hub** for centralized security management

## Architecture & Workflow

1. **Data Inventory**
   - Macie scans selected S3 buckets to build an inventory of objects.  

2. **Sensitive Data Discovery**
   - Machine learning models analyze content to detect sensitive data.  
   - Custom rules can be applied for organization-specific requirements.  

3. **Classification & Tagging**
   - Data is classified by sensitivity level.  
   - Tags are applied for automated monitoring and access control.  

4. **Alerting & Reporting**
   - Macie generates findings and alerts for security teams.  
   - Reports and dashboards provide visibility into sensitive data exposure.  

5. **Remediation**
   - Security teams use findings to adjust permissions, encrypt data, or enforce governance policies.
