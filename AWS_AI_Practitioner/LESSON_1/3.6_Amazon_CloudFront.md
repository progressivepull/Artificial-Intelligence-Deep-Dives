# 3.6 Amazon CloudFront

Amazon CloudFront is a fast, globally distributed content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers web content—including static and dynamic files, streaming media, and APIs—to viewers worldwide with low latency. It caches content in a global network of edge locations, reducing data travel distance and improving load times and user experience.

## How CloudFront Works

- **Distribution Setup**  
  Create a CloudFront distribution and specify the origin (e.g., Amazon S3, EC2, Elastic Load Balancer, or custom HTTP server).

- **Request Routing**  
  User requests are routed to the nearest edge location with the lowest latency.

- **Content Delivery**  
  - **Cache Hit**: If content is cached at the edge, it's delivered instantly.  
  - **Cache Miss**: If not cached, CloudFront fetches it from the origin, serves it, and caches it for future requests.

- **Optimized Network**  
  Traffic between edge locations and AWS regions travels over the secure, high-speed AWS backbone network.
