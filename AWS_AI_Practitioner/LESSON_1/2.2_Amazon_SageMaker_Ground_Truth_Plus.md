# 2.2 Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus

**Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus** is a fully managed data labeling service offered by AWS. It enables customers to create high-quality, labeled training datasets for machine learning (ML) projects **without** the need to build and manage the labeling workflow or workforce themselves.

Unlike the **self-service** version of Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, the **Plus version** provides a **managed solution** where AWS experts and a skilled workforce handle the entire labeling process on your behalf.

## How It Works

1. **Request a project**  
   Submit a request to AWS with details about your data and labeling requirements.

2. **AWS manages the workforce**  
   AWS recruits and manages an expert workforce tailored to your project. Labelers are selected based on specific skills, such as medical expertise for radiology images or domain knowledge for NLP tasks.

3. **Workflow automation**  
   AWS designs and manages the labeling workflow, including **quality assurance** and **ML-powered techniques** (e.g., active learning and pre-labeling).

4. **Labeling and delivery**  
   Data is labeled according to your specifications and delivered to an **Amazon S3 bucket** for use in training ML models.

5. **Quality monitoring**  
   Track project progress, review metrics, and provide feedback using **interactive dashboards**.
