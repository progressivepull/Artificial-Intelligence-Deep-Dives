## Key Capabilities

### Sensitive Data Discovery

- **Managed Data Identifiers**  
  Built-in detectors for common types of sensitive data, including:
  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): names, addresses, Social Security numbers
  - Financial Information: credit card and bank account numbers
  - Protected Health Information (PHI)
  - Credentials and Secrets: private keys, API keys

- **Custom Data Identifiers**  
  Create custom rules to detect organization-specific sensitive data like employee IDs or proprietary formats.

- **Automated Discovery**  
  Profiles S3 buckets using intelligent sampling to scan representative subsets and prioritize buckets with potential risks.

- **Targeted Discovery Jobs**  
  Run one-time or scheduled scans on specific buckets, prefixes, or object tags for deeper analysis.

### Continuous Security Monitoring

- **S3 Bucket Inventory and Security**  
  Maintains a full inventory of S3 buckets and monitors configurations to detect public access or lack of encryption.

- **Threat Detection**  
  Analyzes access patterns and API calls to identify anomalies, such as spikes in data access or changes in bucket permissions.

### Actionable Findings

- **Generated Findings**  
  Detailed alerts for potential issues like exposed sensitive data or publicly accessible buckets.

- **Interactive Data Map**  
  Visualizes where sensitive data resides across accounts, helping prioritize remediation efforts.

- **Integration with AWS Services**  
  Sends findings to Amazon EventBridge and AWS Security Hub for automated workflows and remediation actions.
