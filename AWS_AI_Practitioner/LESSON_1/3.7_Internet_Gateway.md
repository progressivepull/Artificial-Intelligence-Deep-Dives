# 3.7 Internet Gateway

An **Internet Gateway** is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available Amazon VPC component that enables communication between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the public internet. It acts as a bridge, allowing resources in a public subnet to connect to the internet and enabling inbound traffic from the internet to reach those instances.

## How an Internet Gateway Works

To enable internet access for resources within a VPC, an Internet Gateway must be created and attached to that VPC. It works in conjunction with public subnets and route tables to direct traffic.

- **VPC Attachment**  
  The Internet Gateway is attached to your VPC, establishing the logical path for internet traffic. Each VPC requires only one Internet Gateway.

- **Public Subnet**  
  A subnet becomes "public" by adding a route in its route table that directs internet-bound traffic (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4) to the Internet Gateway.

- **Public IP Address**  
  EC2 instances in public subnets must have a public IPv4 address—either auto-assigned or via an Elastic IP—to communicate with the internet.

- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**  
  For IPv4 traffic, the Internet Gateway performs one-to-one NAT, translating between private and public IP addresses for outbound and inbound communication.

## Internet Gateway vs. NAT Gateway

| Feature                | Internet Gateway (IGW)                                                                 | NAT Gateway (NGW)                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**     | Enables direct, bidirectional communication between a VPC and the public internet.    | Allows outbound-only internet access from private subnets; blocks inbound traffic. |
| **Subnet Association**  | Not tied to a specific subnet; serves the entire VPC via route table entries.         | Created in a public subnet; private subnet traffic must be routed to it.          |
| **Traffic Direction**   | Bidirectional: supports both inbound and outbound traffic.                            | Unidirectional: outbound-only from private instances.                             |
| **Cost**                | No charge for the gateway itself; standard data transfer fees apply.                  | Charged per hour and per GB of data processed.                                    |
| **IPv6 Support**        | Supports IPv4 and IPv6; use egress-only IGW for IPv6 outbound from private subnets.   | Supports IPv4; use egress-only IGW for IPv6.                                      |

## How to Secure an Internet Gateway

While the Internet Gateway itself has no configurable security settings, you can secure traffic using other AWS components:

- **Security Groups**  
  Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

- **Network ACLs**  
  Stateless firewalls at the subnet level to manage traffic flow.

- **AWS WAF & Shield**  
  Protect publicly accessible web applications from threats like DDoS attacks and malicious requests.
