# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Overview and Architecture

## What Is a VPC?

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated virtual network within a public cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. It enables users to define and control their own virtual networking environment, offering a private and secure space on shared cloud infrastructure.

VPCs allow you to launch cloud resources—such as virtual machines, databases, and containers—within a network that you configure.

## Key Concepts of a VPC

### Logical Isolation

- Each VPC is isolated from other virtual networks in the same cloud.
- Resources and data within a VPC do not interact with other tenants by default.

### Subnets

- VPCs can be segmented into **subnets**.
- **Public subnets**: Accessible from the internet.
- **Private subnets**: Isolated from direct internet access.

### IP Addressing

- IP ranges are defined using **CIDR notation**.
- Resources in subnets receive private IPs from the defined range.

### Route Tables

- Control how traffic is routed within the VPC and between subnets.
- Define rules for directing packets to their destinations.

### Internet Gateway

- Enables communication between VPC resources and the public internet.
- Must be attached to the VPC and referenced in route tables.

### NAT Gateway

- Allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound internet connections.
- Prevents unsolicited inbound traffic from reaching private resources.

### Security

- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls at the instance level; manage inbound/outbound traffic.
- **Network ACLs**: Stateless firewalls at the subnet level; provide additional security layers.

### VPC Peering

- Connects two VPCs privately.
- Enables seamless communication between instances across VPCs.

### Transit Gateway

- Central hub for routing traffic between multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
- Ideal for complex, large-scale network topologies.

## Common Use Cases

- **Hybrid Cloud Deployments**  
  Extend on-premises infrastructure into the cloud using VPN or dedicated connections.

- **Multi-Tier Web Applications**  
  Host web servers in public subnets and databases in private subnets for secure architecture.

- **Cloud Migration**  
  Migrate legacy applications and data into a secure, isolated cloud environment.

- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**  
  Provision secure, high-speed networking for compute-intensive workloads in industries like finance and healthcare.

## VPC vs. VPN

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **VPC** | A logically isolated virtual network that hosts cloud resources. |
| **VPN** | A secure, encrypted tunnel that connects external networks (e.g., on-premises) to the VPC. |

> VPC is the **destination**, while VPN is the **secure pathway** used to reach it.
