# 2.0 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a core artificial intelligence (AI) technique in which an algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions based on a **labeled dataset**. The "labeled" data provides the correct answer for each piece of input, acting as a teacher or *supervisor* to guide the model's training process. The goal is for the model to generalize from this labeled data and accurately predict the output for new, unseen data.

## How Supervised Learning Works

1. **Data preparation**  
   A large, high-quality dataset is gathered and labeled with the correct output for each data point.  
   *Example:* A dataset of emails labeled as either *"spam"* or *"not spam."*

2. **Model training**  
   The labeled data is fed into a supervised learning algorithm, which iteratively adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual labels.

3. **Model evaluation**  
   The trained model is evaluated on a separate test dataset that it has never seen before, measuring its ability to generalize to new data.

4. **Prediction (Inference)**  
   Once the model performs satisfactorily, it is deployed to make predictions on new, unlabeled data in real-world applications.

## Types of Supervised Learning Problems

### 1. Classification
- **Definition:** Predicts a discrete or categorical outcome by assigning an input into one of several predefined classes.  
- **Example:** Training a model on a dataset of labeled emails to predict if a new email is *"spam"* or *"not spam."*  
- **Common algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests.

### 2. Regression
- **Definition:** Predicts a continuous numerical value.  
- **Example:** Training a model on historical data to predict a houseâ€™s price based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.  
- **Common algorithms:** Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| Aspect        | Advantages                                                                 | Disadvantages                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**  | Tends to be more accurate and predictable than other ML methods with good data. | Model quality depends heavily on the quality of labeled training data.        |
| **Objectivity** | Goal is clearly defined, with a specific output to achieve.               | Collecting and labeling large datasets is time-consuming and expensive.       |
| **Evaluation** | Easy to measure performance by comparing predictions with known labels.   | Models may overfit, becoming too specialized to training data.                |
| **Transparency** | Some algorithms (e.g., decision trees) are easy to interpret.            | Struggles to handle data very different from training data, reducing flexibility. |
