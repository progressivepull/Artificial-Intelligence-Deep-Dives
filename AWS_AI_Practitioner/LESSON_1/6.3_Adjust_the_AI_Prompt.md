# Prompt Engineering: Adjusting AI Prompts for Better Output

## Overview

**Prompt engineering** is the practice of refining instructions given to an AI model to improve the relevance, consistency, and quality of its responses. Rather than settling for vague or unhelpful output, prompt engineering empowers users to guide the AI's behavior more effectively.

## Basic Prompt Adjustments

### 1. Be More Specific

Vague prompts lead to vague answers, as the AI fills in gaps with its own assumptions.

- **Instead of**:  
  `"Write a social media post."`

- **Try**:  
  `"Write three short Instagram captions for a bakery promoting its new weekend brunch specials. Use a cheerful tone and include food-related emojis."`

### 2. Provide Context

Clarify the intent and audience to help the AI tailor its response.

- **Example**:  
  Instead of asking for email writing tips, specify:  
  `"Give tips for writing persuasive emails to convert cold leads. Act as a sales copywriting expert."`

### 3. Assign a Role

Instruct the AI to adopt a persona or professional role to shape tone and expertise.

- **Example**:  
  `"Act as a programming instructor and explain recursion to beginners."`

### 4. Specify Output Format

Define how the response should be structured to save time and improve clarity.

- **Example**:  
  `"List the benefits in bullet points, each no longer than one sentence."`

### 5. Set Negative Constraints

Prevent unwanted content by stating what to avoid.

- **Example**:  
  `"Do not include technical jargon or promotional language."`

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Encourage logical reasoning by asking the AI to "think step-by-step."

- **Example**:  
  `"Explain how to solve this math problem step-by-step."`

### Few-Shot Prompting

Provide input-output examples to demonstrate the desired pattern.

- **Example**:  

Input: "Red velvet cake"         
Output: "A rich, moist dessert with a hint of cocoa and cream cheese frosting."


### Decomposition

Break large problems into smaller, manageable prompts.

- **Example**:  
First ask: `"List key features of the product."`  
Then follow up: `"Write a product description using those features."`

### System Instructions

Set consistent rules or personas for the AI to follow throughout the session.

- **Example**:  
`"You are a helpful assistant who always responds in Markdown format."`

## Iteration is Key

Prompt engineering is an iterative process. If the initial response isn't satisfactory:

- Refine the prompt.
- Add more context.
- Adjust formatting instructions.
- Try a different role or tone.

Each revision helps guide the AI toward more accurate and useful output.
