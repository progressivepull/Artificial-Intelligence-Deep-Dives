# 2.7 Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)

Amazon S3 Server-Side Encryption with S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3) is a form of server-side encryption where Amazon S3 handles both the encryption and key management. Since January 2023, SSE-S3 is the default encryption type for all new objects uploaded to S3 buckets.

## How SSE-S3 Works

The process uses multiple layers of encryption that are handled entirely by AWS:

- **Encryption Keys for Each Object**  
  When you upload an object, S3 creates a unique data key to encrypt that specific object using the AES-256 encryption algorithm.

- **Key Protection**  
  The unique data key is encrypted with a frequently rotated master key managed by S3.

- **Encrypted Storage**  
  Both the encrypted object and encrypted data key are stored together. The plaintext data key is discarded from memory immediately after use.

- **Automatic Decryption**  
  When an authorized user requests the object, S3 decrypts the data key using the master key and then decrypts the object before returning it.

## Key Characteristics and Use Cases

- **Minimal Management**  
  SSE-S3 requires no key management from the user. No extra code, no key rotation, and no additional fees beyond standard storage costs.

- **Defense Against Physical Theft**  
  Protects data from unauthorized physical access to AWS data center hardware.

- **Simple Compliance**  
  Ideal for organizations needing basic encryption at rest without complex key management.

- **Bucket Policy Enforcement**  
  Enforce SSE-S3 by configuring a bucket policy to deny PUT requests lacking the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header.

## Limitations of SSE-S3

- **Limited Separation of Duties**  
  A user with full S3 access can also decrypt data, which may not meet strict regulatory requirements.

- **No Audit Trails or Key Revocation**  
  For finer-grained control, audit logging, and revocable access, consider alternatives like SSE-KMS.
