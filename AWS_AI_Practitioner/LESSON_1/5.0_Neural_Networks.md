# üß† 5.0 Neural Networks

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure of the human brain, used in machine learning to discover complex patterns in data. It consists of interconnected processing units, or **artificial neurons**, organized into layers. These networks learn from data and improve their performance over time.

## üß© Key Components of a Neural Network

All neural networks share a common architecture:

- **Neurons**:  
  Basic units that receive inputs, perform mathematical operations, and produce outputs.

- **Layers**:  
  Neurons are grouped into layers:
  - **Input Layer**: Receives raw data (e.g., pixel values, dataset features).
  - **Hidden Layer(s)**: Intermediate layers that perform computations and extract features.
  - **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification.

- **Weights and Biases**:  
  - **Weights** determine the strength of connections between neurons.  
  - **Biases** allow shifting the activation function.  
  - Both are adjusted during training to improve accuracy.

- **Activation Function**:  
  Introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex relationships. Common functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.

## üîÑ How a Neural Network Learns

Neural networks learn through an iterative process:

1. **Forward Propagation**  
   Data flows from input to output, with each neuron applying weights, biases, and an activation function.

2. **Error Calculation**  
   The output is compared to the actual result using a **loss function**.

3. **Backpropagation**  
   The error is sent backward through the network to determine how each weight and bias contributed.

4. **Weight Update**  
   Using optimization techniques like **gradient descent**, weights and biases are adjusted to reduce error.
