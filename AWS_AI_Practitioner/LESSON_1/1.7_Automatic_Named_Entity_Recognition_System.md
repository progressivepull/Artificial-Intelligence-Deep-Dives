# 1.7 Automatic Named Entity Recognition System

# üìå What Is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is a technique in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that automatically identifies and classifies key elements (called *entities*) in text.  

### Common Entity Types
- **Person names** (e.g., *Elon Musk*)  
- **Organizations** (e.g., *Microsoft, NASA*)  
- **Locations** (e.g., *New York, Paris*)  
- **Dates and times** (e.g., *September 22, 2025*)  
- **Other entities**: medical terms, products, events, etc.  

üëâ NER helps transform **unstructured text** into **structured data**, making it easier to analyze, search, or automate tasks.

## üé• YouTube Example: Biomedical NER System with BioBERT

A tutorial by **Humanitarians AI** demonstrates building a biomedical NER system using **BioBERT** (a BERT model fine-tuned for medical text) and **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient training).

### üîß Steps Covered
1. Preprocessing clinical text (e.g., *MIMIC-III notes*)  
2. Aligning tokens with labels  
3. Fine-tuning BioBERT with LoRA adapters  
4. Evaluating with **precision, recall, and F1-score**  
5. Extracting entities such as **diseases** and **chemicals**  

üí° Especially useful in **healthcare**, where NER can extract insights from:  
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)  
- Research papers  
- Drug safety reports

## üß† How NER Works (Behind the Scenes)

NER systems typically use:  
- **Rule-based methods** (e.g., regular expressions, dictionaries)  
- **Machine learning models** (e.g., decision trees, CRFs)  
- **Deep learning models** (e.g., BERT, spaCy, BioBERT)  

‚û°Ô∏è Modern systems like **spaCy** combine **rule-based logic** with **trained models** to identify entities even in noisy or domain-specific text.
