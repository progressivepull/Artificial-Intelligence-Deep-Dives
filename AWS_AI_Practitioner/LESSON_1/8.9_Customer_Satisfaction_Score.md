## Calculation

CSAT is typically calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{CSAT (\%)} = \frac{\text{Number of satisfied responses}}{\text{Total responses}} \times 100

- **Satisfied responses**: Usually ratings considered positive (e.g., 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale).  
- **Total responses**: All customers who provided feedback.

### Example
- 80 out of 100 respondents gave a 4 or 5 rating.  
- CSAT = (80 / 100) × 100 = **80%**
