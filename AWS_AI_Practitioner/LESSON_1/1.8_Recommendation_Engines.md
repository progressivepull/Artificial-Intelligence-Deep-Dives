# 1.8 Recommendation Engines

A recommendation engine (or recommender system) is a type of algorithm that suggests items to users based on various forms of input data. These systems are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, and YouTube to personalize content and improve user engagement.

Here‚Äôs a structured breakdown to help you understand or build one:

# üß† Core Types of Recommendation Engines

| Type                   | Description                                                        | Example Use Case                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Content-Based Filtering** | Recommends items similar to those the user liked in the past        | Suggesting movies with similar genres or actors |
| **Collaborative Filtering** | Recommends items based on user behavior and preferences of similar users | ‚ÄúUsers who liked this also liked‚Ä¶‚Äù             |
| **Hybrid Models**           | Combines multiple approaches for better accuracy                   | Netflix‚Äôs recommendation algorithm             |
| **Knowledge-Based**         | Uses explicit user preferences and item attributes                  | Travel booking or real estate                  |

# üß∞ Key Components

- **User Data**: Preferences, ratings, clicks, purchase history  
- **Item Data**: Metadata like genre, category, price, tags  
- **Similarity Metrics**: Cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, Jaccard index  

### Modeling Techniques
- Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD)  
- Deep Learning (e.g., Autoencoders, Neural Collaborative Filtering)  
- Graph-Based Models  
- Reinforcement Learning

# ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Libraries

- **Python Libraries**: Surprise, LightFM, TensorFlow Recommenders, RecBole  
- **Frameworks**: Apache Spark MLlib, NVIDIA Merlin  
- **Datasets for Practice**: MovieLens, Amazon Reviews, Goodbooks-10k

# üìä Evaluation Metrics

| Metric           | Purpose                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Precision/Recall** | Measures relevance of recommendations |
| **RMSE/MAE**         | Measures prediction accuracy         |
| **NDCG**             | Measures ranking quality             |
| **Coverage**         | Measures diversity of recommendations |
