## Key Features

### 1. Object and Scene Detection
- Identifies thousands of objects (e.g., cars, furniture, animals).
- Recognizes scenes and activities (e.g., "beach," "playing soccer").

### 2. Facial Analysis
- Detects faces in images and videos.
- Analyzes attributes such as:
  - Age range
  - Gender
  - Emotions
  - Facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth)

### 3. Face Recognition
- Compares faces across images for **verification and identification**.
- Manages collections of known faces for search and matching.

### 4. Content Moderation
- Detects inappropriate or unsafe content:
  - Explicit nudity
  - Violence
  - Weapons or drugs
- Helps maintain compliance for platforms hosting user-generated content.

### 5. Text Detection
- Detects and extracts text in images (OCR).
- Supports printed and handwritten text.

### 6. Celebrity Recognition
- Identifies well-known celebrities in images and videos.

### 7. PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Detection
- Detects safety equipment such as:
  - Helmets
  - Vests
  - Masks
- Useful for compliance in industrial and workplace safety.

## Architecture & Workflow

1. **Input**  
   - Images or videos uploaded to **Amazon S3**.  

2. **Processing**  
   - Rekognition APIs perform image/video analysis.  
   - Options: synchronous (immediate results) or asynchronous (large video jobs).  

3. **Output**  
   - JSON response containing detected labels, faces, emotions, and text.  
   - Results can be integrated into downstream applications (e.g., dashboards, alerting systems).  

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Security & Surveillance**  
  Face recognition for access control and public safety monitoring.  

- **E-commerce & Retail**  
  Visual search, product tagging, and content moderation for customer images.  

- **Media & Entertainment**  
  Automated metadata tagging for video archives and celebrity detection.  

- **Industrial Safety**  
  PPE compliance monitoring in manufacturing or construction environments.  

- **Social Media Platforms**  
  Filtering inappropriate user-generated content automatically.
