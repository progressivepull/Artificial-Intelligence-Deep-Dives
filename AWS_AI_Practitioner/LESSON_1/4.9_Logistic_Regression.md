# 🔐 4.9 Logistic Regression 

Logistic regression is a statistical and machine learning method used to predict the **probability of a categorical outcome** based on one or more independent variables. Despite its name, it is a **classification algorithm**, not a regression algorithm, because its output is a **finite, discrete value** rather than a continuous one.

## ⚙️ How Logistic Regression Works

To understand logistic regression, it's helpful to contrast it with linear regression:

- **Linear regression** outputs any numerical value.
- **Logistic regression** handles outcomes that fall into distinct categories (e.g., "yes/no", "spam/not spam", "pass/fail").

### 🔢 Three Key Steps

1. **Linear Combination**  
   Logistic regression first computes a linear combination of input features:
   

$$
z = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n
$$



2. **Sigmoid Function**  
   The result $$z$$ is passed through the sigmoid function to produce a probability:


$$
p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$



3. **Classification Threshold**  
   A threshold (typically 0.5) is applied to convert the probability into a class label:
   - If $$p > 0.5$$ → Class "1"
   - If $$p < 0.5$$ → Class "0"

## 🧠 Types of Logistic Regression

### 1. Binary Logistic Regression
- **Use Case**: Predicting a yes/no outcome (e.g., will a customer purchase?).

### 2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
- **Use Case**: Predicting one of several categories without order (e.g., product category A, B, or C).

### 3. Ordinal Logistic Regression
- **Use Case**: Predicting ordered categories (e.g., satisfaction: poor, fair, good, excellent).

## 🔍 Key Differences: Logistic vs Linear Regression

| Feature              | Linear Regression                                              | Logistic Regression                                                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Output Type**      | Predicts a continuous value (e.g., house price)                | Predicts a categorical outcome and its probability                        |
| **Equation**         | Uses a linear equation: $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$$            | Uses a sigmoid function: $$p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$                    |
| **Relationship**     | Linear relationship between variables                          | Linear relationship between variables and log-odds                        |
| **Loss Function**    | Minimizes sum of squared errors (SSE)                          | Maximizes log-likelihood (iterative process)                              |
| **Curve**            | Straight line                                                  | S-shaped (sigmoid) curve                                                  |
