# 7.4 Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base 

 # Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base

## Overview
Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base is a **fully managed capability** within **Amazon Bedrock** that enables developers to connect **foundation models (FMs)** to their **enterprise data sources** for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  

With a knowledge base, applications powered by Bedrock can **ground model outputs** on up-to-date, domain-specific information, reducing **hallucinations** and improving **accuracy** in generative AI use cases.

## Key Features

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Enhances LLM responses with external data.
- Retrieves relevant context from a vector database before generating outputs.
- Reduces reliance solely on model pretraining.

### 2. Fully Managed Infrastructure
- Automates the setup of vector databases (Amazon OpenSearch, Pinecone, or other supported stores).
- Provides ingestion pipelines for document loading, parsing, and embedding generation.
- Manages indexing and query workflows.

### 3. Multi-Source Data Integration
- Supports structured and unstructured data:
  - Documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
  - Knowledge bases (FAQs, manuals)
  - Enterprise systems
- Secure connectivity with AWS IAM policies.

### 4. Seamless Bedrock Integration
- Connects knowledge bases directly to foundation models available in **Amazon Bedrock**.
- Eliminates the need for separate infrastructure for embeddings, retrieval, and orchestration.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Source data is ingested from S3 or external systems.
   - Data is chunked, transformed, and embedded into vector representations.

2. **Vector Store**
   - Embeddings stored in a vector database (e.g., OpenSearch Service, Pinecone).
   - Supports similarity search for relevant context retrieval.

3. **Query Handling**
   - User queries are transformed into embeddings.
   - The knowledge base retrieves the most relevant chunks.

4. **Augmented Generation**
   - Retrieved context is passed into the foundation model.
   - Bedrock generates a grounded response using both the query and contextual data.

## Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support**  
  Enable AI assistants to answer support tickets using company knowledge bases.  

- **Healthcare & Life Sciences**  
  Retrieve clinical trial data, research papers, and patient documentation.  

- **Financial Services**  
  Enhance chatbots with regulatory guidelines and policy documents.  

- **Enterprise Productivity**  
  Search across internal wikis, manuals, and documentation to improve employee productivity.
