# 1.2 Writes a report about trained machine learning (ML) models


# üß† Key Concepts in Transparency and Explainability

## Define the Purpose of the Report
The report should clarify the model‚Äôs objectives, use cases, and performance metrics.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Fairness, Transparency, & Explainability in AI | AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K11YB9rN2Yc) ‚Äî explores how fairness and transparency are essential for ethical AI, and includes practical tools for responsible AI evaluation.

## Explain Model Architecture and Interpretability
Stakeholders need to understand whether the model is a black box (e.g., deep learning) or interpretable (e.g., decision trees).  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [What A.I. transparency is and how it relates to Explainable A.I.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hHMwLxN6EM) ‚Äî breaks down the difference between interpretable models and opaque ones, and discusses evaluation strategies.

## Use Explainable AI (XAI) Techniques
Techniques like SHAP values, saliency maps, and model cards help visualize and explain predictions.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Explainable AI: Transparency, Ethics, and Alignment | Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj2pq_kOyJY) ‚Äî introduces these tools and shows how they enhance stakeholder understanding.

---

## Highlight Business Impact and Trust
Explain how model decisions affect business outcomes, risk, and customer experience.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Explainable AI improves transparency in machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSW7ED-5L3w) ‚Äî shows how XAI builds trust in sectors like finance and healthcare, making it easier for stakeholders to accept AI-driven decisions.

---

## Address Challenges and Limitations
Be honest about model limitations, biases, and areas needing improvement.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Explainable AI: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uK9jtuB7wA) ‚Äî discusses the real-world hurdles in deploying explainable AI and how to overcome them.

---

## Compare Interpretability Methods
Choose between intrinsically interpretable models and post-hoc explanations.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Introduction to Explainable AI (XAI) | Interpretable models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB2X3JBjtMY) ‚Äî offers a clear overview of model-agnostic vs. model-specific methods.

---

## Demonstrate with Case Studies or Examples
Use real data and predictions to show how the model behaves.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [How interpretability paves the way for building an explainable AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_99rWTJ7KQ) ‚Äî walks through a case study using counterfactual explanations and data outputs.
