# 1.2 Writes a report about trained machine learning (ML) models


# üß† Key Concepts in Transparency and Explainability

## Define the Purpose of the Report
The report should clarify the model‚Äôs objectives, use cases, and performance metrics.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Fairness, Transparency, & Explainability in AI | AI Fundamentals Course | 4.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1csEUPwmsj8) ‚Äî explores how fairness and transparency are essential for ethical AI, and includes practical tools for responsible AI evaluation.

## Explain Model Architecture and Interpretability
Stakeholders need to understand whether the model is a black box (e.g., deep learning) or interpretable (e.g., decision trees).  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [What A.I. transparency is and how it relates to Explainable A.I.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hHMwLxN6EM) ‚Äî breaks down the difference between interpretable models and opaque ones, and discusses evaluation strategies.

## Use Explainable AI (XAI) Techniques
Techniques like SHAP values, saliency maps, and model cards help visualize and explain predictions.

‚Äî introduces these tools and shows how they enhance stakeholder understanding.

## Highlight Business Impact and Trust
Explain how model decisions affect business outcomes, risk, and customer experience.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Explainable AI improves transparency in machine learning predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWnak4woFhM) ‚Äî shows how XAI builds trust in sectors like finance and healthcare, making it easier for stakeholders to accept AI-driven decisions.

---

## Address Challenges and Limitations
Be honest about model limitations, biases, and areas needing improvement.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Explainable AI: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PacjViAET7U) ‚Äî discusses the real-world hurdles in deploying explainable AI and how to overcome them.

---

## Compare Interpretability Methods
Choose between intrinsically interpretable models and post-hoc explanations.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Introduction to Explainable AI (XAI) | Interpretable models, agnostic methods, counterfactuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuDijSIR9iM) ‚Äî offers a clear overview of model-agnostic vs. model-specific methods.

---

## Demonstrate with Case Studies or Examples
Use real data and predictions to show how the model behaves.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [How interpretability paves the way for building an explainable AI system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO9_PwX1keo) ‚Äî walks through a case study using counterfactual explanations and data outputs.
