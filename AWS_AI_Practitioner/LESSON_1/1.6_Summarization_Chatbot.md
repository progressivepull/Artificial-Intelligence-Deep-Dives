# 1.6 Summarization Chatbot

A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, typically through text or voice interactions. You’ve probably seen them pop up on websites, social media, or messaging apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.

# 🧠 What Chatbots Do

* **Answer questions**: Like “What are your store hours?” or “Do you ship internationally?”
* **Provide support**: Help troubleshoot issues or guide users through processes.
* **Automate tasks**: Book appointments, track orders, or even help with purchases.

# ⚙️ How They Work

* **Rule-based chatbots**: Follow predefined scripts and respond to specific keywords.
* **AI-powered chatbots**: Use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand and respond more flexibly, like ChatGPT or Google Gemini2.

# 🧪 Examples

* **ELIZA (1966)**: One of the earliest chatbots, mimicked a psychotherapist.
* **Modern AI chatbots**: Found in customer service, virtual assistants (like Siri or Alexa), and educational tools.
