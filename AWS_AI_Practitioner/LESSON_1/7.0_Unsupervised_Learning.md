# Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

Unsupervised Learning is a branch of Machine Learning where algorithms are used to identify patterns in data without pre-existing labels. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled datasets, unsupervised learning works with input data **without corresponding output values**.

## Key Characteristics

- **No Labeled Data**: The model learns from raw, untagged data.
- **Pattern Discovery**: It identifies structures, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Often used for data exploration and dimensionality reduction.

## Common Algorithms

### 1. Clustering

Grouping data points based on similarity.

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

Reducing the number of input variables in a dataset.

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
- **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**
- **Autoencoders**

### 3. Association Rule Learning

Finding relationships between variables in large datasets.

- **Apriori Algorithm**
- **Eclat Algorithm**

## Applications

- **Market Segmentation**: Identifying customer segments.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detecting unusual patterns or outliers.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products based on user behavior.
- **Data Compression**: Reducing storage and improving efficiency.

## Advantages

- Can discover hidden patterns in data.
- Works well with complex and unlabeled datasets.
- Useful for data exploration and pre-processing.

## Challenges

- Hard to evaluate accuracy without labels.
- Risk of discovering patterns that are not meaningful.
- Sensitive to data scaling and noise.

## Conclusion

Unsupervised learning plays a crucial role in data analysis, especially when labeled data is scarce or unavailable. It helps uncover hidden patterns and provides insights that can be foundational for further supervised learning tasks or business intelligence.
